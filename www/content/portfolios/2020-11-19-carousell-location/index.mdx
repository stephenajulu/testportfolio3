Started in 2012, Carousell launched the first mobile app in Singapore. In 2020, Carousell transformed into the biggest classifieds marketplace in Southeast Asia, with 20+ million users across 7 major markets.

In 2019, after acquired and migrated OLX Philippines, Carousell became the biggest classified marketplace in the Philippines.

The app was primarily designed for Singapore, a small country, struggled to scale to multi-city countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia.

Rebuilding the location while browsing and searching for items is one of the most important things we need to improve.

###### The Challenge
## A better location treatment works across all countries and categories
High-level goals were to:
- Make it easy to understand and easy to use for everyone, in different countries
- Increase content relevance on discovering and search journey
- Give buyers a more engaging and relevant content


## My role
I led the design of the new location picker across iOS, Android, mobile, and desktop Web since the outset of the project in May 2020.

<div class="Grid Col2 Small Space-Small">
  <div>
    <h4>Insights & Ideation</h4>
    <p>I partnered with three product managers and two other designers to uncover insights, ideate, and translate concepts into features.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Planning & Scope Definition</h4>
    <p>I defined the product with my product manager. I prioritized and negotiated features for launch and beyond.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Design Execution & Validation</h4>
    <p>I designed for iOS, Android, mobile Web, and desktop Web. I executed journeys, wireframes, prototypes, usability test, design specs, and collaborate with Engineers.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Leadership</h4>
    <p>I presented works to gain buy‐in from executives, senior stakeholders, and many other teams throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Early insights

### The current location approach

The app was first designed for Singapore so we took the radius approach. When searching items, buyers pick a location and use a radius to expand or collapse the area to filter the items.


<div class="Grid Col2-ShortLeft Small">
  <div>
    <p>
      This approach works for countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan where the transport is convenient and small. People can go anywhere with convenient public transport.
    </p>
    <p>
      When bringing it to bigger countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, people don’t understand it. In another word, the radius is not useful there, where 1km from a location could mean in a different city or an inaccessible area.
    </p>
  </div>

  </div>
</div>

### Feedback from users
We reached to our Customer Voice colleagues frequently to ask them for feedback from our users. After migrated OLX to Carousell, we got a lot of feedback about the location.

Many people don’t know how to use the radius location picker:

<div class="Image__Small">
  <img src="./images/image-location-1.png" />
</div>

Some people don’t they know can filter by locations
<div class="Image__Small">
  <img src="./images/image-location-2.png" />
</div>

Not only getting insights from Customer Voice, but I also dived into some user researches that other colleagues did in the Philippines to get a deeper understanding

<div class="Image__Small">
  <img src="./images/image-location-3.png" />
</div>

<div class="Image__Small">
  <img src="./images/image-location-4.png" />
</div>


###### A deeper understanding
## Backup with data
Qualitative insights from users are not enough to convince stakeholders to invest in this project. I worked with a PM and Data Analyst to pull out some data to cover for our assumption. We know that:

- If people use the location filter, the View listings to Transaction conversion is 50% higher than without using the location.
- The further away listing from the user’s location, the lesser chance of being transacted.
- The usage of location picker is very high in multi-city state countries (15%), but very small in Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong (2%).

Note: For confidentiality reasons, I have omitted the actual values for these metrics.

###### Frame the solution
## The importance of location
Carousell is a classified marketplace, more than half of the listings are used ones. People usually do meet-ups to check the item before buying it. So knowing the location around their areas is very important.

To make it easier to communicate our ideas to other people, we created a storyboard to convey our understanding.

<div class="Grid Col2 Small Space-Small">
  <div>
    <img src="./images/image-location-5.jpg" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="./images/image-location-6.jpg" />

  </div>
  <div>

###### Explore ideas
## How we built it
After everyone was on the same page and got a common understanding of the problem and the importance of location. With two Product Managers and two other designers, we did brainstorm to find ideas and prioritized what we should do for the new location pickers.

(Pssst: Thanks for Miro that we can do online brainstorming in the pandemic period).

  <img src="./images/image-location-11.jpg" />
</div>

### Rough wireframes/mockup to communicate ideas
In a big organization, the earlier we share, the smoother process.

To communicate our ideas early, I started with wireframes (web) and rough mockup (app) then share with other designers to get feedback. It’s also a good deliverable to share with people outside of product teams about the solution.

  <div>
    <img src="./images/image-location-12.jpg" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="./images/image-location-13.jpg" />
  </div>
</div>


### Narrow down ideas and usability test
Many times, designers have many ideas and don't know which one is better. The same thing happened to me. But it's a soft headache. 

First, I tried to come up with many ideas as possible. Then I picked some and share it with the whole Product Designer team to discuss designs.

Then I updated the design and shared it with stakeholders, including PMs from other teams, category managers, and country managers to get aligned with the direction.

After that, there were still two ideas that we can’t agree on. So I used both two ideas to do a usability test to see how people interact.

<div class="Image__Small">
  <img src="./images/image-location-14.png" />
  <figcaption>Which one is better? I don't know</figcaption>
</div>

The good thing during the pandemic period is that we don't have to limit the participant physically. So we can recruit people in the Philippines without going there. With a bit of preparation, we did it very smoothly.

With the insights from the test, we are more confident with the solution and get alignment from the team. And I’m confident to spend more time in the detail and refinement.

    <h4>Browse by location areas</h4>
    <p>
      Moving out from radius location, replace it with location areas.

    <p>
     They can search for the most common administrative areas. And it is localised for different countries. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Philippines, people can search by Province, City, or Baranggay. In Singapore, people can browse by MRT, Estate, or District.

    <h4>Listing card</h4>
    <p>
      For property, we created a different listing card, list view, to show more information. Location of a house is an important information to help people find suitable houses easier.

    <h4>Clearer system feedback</h4>
    <p>
      Number of item indicators to show the system state as a guide for people to decide if they should use filter to narrow down or change to a bigger area to see more available items. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We didn't have it before because we didn't want our competitors to know where we are in the market. But it’s useful info for buyers while search. So we have to find a way to balance it.

## What next?
We’re going to launch this feature first in the Philippines, then Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other countries in Southeast Asia. But it should not become just a one-time delivery. In Carousell, we always iterate the product with data and post-launch research.
