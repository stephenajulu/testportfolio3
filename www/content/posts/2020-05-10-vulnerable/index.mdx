Kryptonite, of course, is something to be avoided. Kryptonite, whatever your particular variety is, can kill you. It can pierce your armor and leave you helpless.

It's not right.

Without kryptonite, Superman doesn't matter, as he is without weakness, invulnerable, and boring.

Kryptonite makes superman real.

Vulnerable is the only way we can feel when we truly share the art we’ve made. When we share it, we have made ourselves naked in front of the person we’ve given the gift of our art to.

When we’re vulnerable, we’re open doors for innovation and strengthen relationships.

## It’s a symptom of innovation

If not enough people doubt you, you're not making a difference.

“The resistance is a symptom that you're on the right track. The resistance is not something to be avoided; it's something to seek out” as Seth Godin said in the book “The Icarus Deception”

If you’re not willing to be laughed at, you won’t create something innovative. You need to be comfortable being vulnerable to innovate.

## It opens up communication

Have you ever gotten a touchy issue, but didn’t know how to solve it? You were afraid to share it with other people. Because you thought they would laugh at you when if they knew.

But one day, you decided to share it and asked for help. Surprisingly, some people reached to you and admit they had the same issue. That was the time you strengthened the relationship.

When you speak your truth, you have opened: door, allowing others to speak to you, directly to you, to your true self.

Being vulnerable is scary, but it helps you grow as a person and opens the opportunity for others around you to do the same.

> "Good healthy communication is impossible without openness, honesty, and vulnerability”
> <cite>Paul Kendall</cite>

As designers, we need to have good lines of communication with the people we work with and the people using our products/services. Having this honest and open communication leads to greater connections and greater insights.

By being vulnerable, we stop aiming for perfection. We are all imperfect anyway.

Share your works, your thoughts, your arts.

Be vulnerable.


Note:
I’m not an expert. I’m just on a journey and would like to share that with you.
