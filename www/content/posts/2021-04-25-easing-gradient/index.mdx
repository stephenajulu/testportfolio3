First, let’s take a look at those 2 photos from 500px and Unsplash. They have the same idea when hovering over an image, it shows overlay additional info. Tell me which one gives you more aesthetic pleasure?

<div class="Image__Small">
  <img src="./images/trongnguyen-easing-gradient-1.png" />
</div>

Of course, the Unsplash one is much better. But why?

500px uses a linear gradient for the overlay background. Linear gradients often have hard edges where they start and/or end. When transitioning between colors the edges become prominent if we don’t ease-in-out of it.

We can avoid those by controlling the color mix. The examples below have the same amount of blackness behind the text.

<div class="Image__Small">
  <img src="./images/trongnguyen-easing-gradient-2.png" />
</div>


To archive that effect on our design, we will have to pick color manually. It will be very painful. But with help from plugins like [Easing Gradients](https://larsenwork.com/easing-gradients/#editor) for Figma, our life will be easier.
